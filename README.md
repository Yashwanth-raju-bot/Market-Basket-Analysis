# Market-Basket-Analysis
An implementation of Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm in Python to discover association rules and frequent itemsets from transactional data.

## Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm

This project applies Market Basket Analysis to uncover hidden patterns in customer purchase behavior using the Apriori algorithm. The goal is to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules from transactional data, which can be used to inform product bundling, cross-selling, and inventory decisions.

### Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and transaction formatting
- Frequent itemset mining using Apriori (via MLxtend)
- Association rule generation with support, confidence, and lift
- Visualization of results using matplotlib/seaborn

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- MLxtend
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

### Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** – Main programming language
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **MLxtend** – Apriori algorithm & association rule mining
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** – For running and exploring the project

### Usage:
1. Install requirements from `requirements.txt`
2. Run `generate_market_basket_report.py` along with the dataset (market_basket_dataset.csv) to process the dataset and generate rules
3. Analyze the output and visualizations

### Note
The code is just tailored for the given dataset only!
